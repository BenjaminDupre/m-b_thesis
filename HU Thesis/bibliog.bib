abstract = {The brain continuously processes information coming from both the external environment and visceral signals generated by the body. This constant information exchange between the body and the brain allows signals originating from the oscillatory activity of the heart, among others, to influence perception. Here, we investigated how the cardiac phase modulates multisensory integration, which is the process that allows information from multiple senses to combine non-linearly to reduce environmental uncertainty. Forty healthy participants completed a Simple Detection Task with unimodal (Auditory, Visual, Tactile) and bimodal (Audio-Tactile, Audio-Visual, Visuo-Tactile) stimuli presented 250 ms and 500 ms after the R-peak of the electrocardiogram, that is, systole and diastole, respectively. First, we found a nonspecific effect of the cardiac cycle phases on detection of both unimodal and bimodal stimuli. Reaction times were faster for stimuli presented during diastole, compared to systole. Then, applying the Race Model Inequality approach to quantify multisensory integration, Audio-Tactile and Visuo-Tactile, but not Audio-Visual stimuli, showed higher integration when presented during diastole than during systole. These findings indicate that the impact of the cardiac phase on multisensory integration may be specific for stimuli including somatosensory (i.e., tactile) inputs. This suggests that the heartbeat-related noise, which according to the interoceptive predictive coding theory suppresses somatosensory inputs, also affects multisensory integration during systole. In conclusion, our data extend the interoceptive predictive coding theory to the multisensory domain. From a more mechanistic view, they may reflect a reduced optimization of neural oscillations orchestrating multisensory integration during systole.}

  abstract = "Twenty-six subjects were tested with a tachistoscopic recognition
              task while heart rate and several other autonomic indexes were
              monitored. In Experiment 1, heart rate was employed as an
              independent variable, and stimulus presentation was contingent
              upon the presence of individually determined low, middle, and
              high heart rates. The results indicated that low heart rate
              facilitated performance especially for stimuli presented at the
              fastest exposure. In Experiment 2, stimulus presentation was
              dependent upon cardiac phase. The findings indicated that
              stimulus recognition was enhanced during the cardiac P wave, but
              the effect was apparent only during the fastest exposure.
              Multiple regression analyses of the individual subject's data

Such models make a prediction about the probability distributions of reaction times that is often calledthe race model inequality, and it is often of interest to test this prediction.

abstract = {Even though humans are mostly not aware of their heartbeats, several heartbeat-related effects have been reported to influence conscious perception. It is not clear whether these effects are distinct or related phenomena, or whether they are early sensory effects or late decisional processes. Combining electroencephalography and electrocardiography, along with signal detection theory analyses, we identify two distinct heartbeat-related influences on conscious perception differentially related to early vs. late somatosensory processing. First, an effect on early sensory processing was found for the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), a marker of cardiac interoception. The amplitude of the prestimulus HEP negatively correlated with localization and detection of somatosensory stimuli, reflecting a more conservative detection bias (criterion). Importantly, higher HEP amplitudes were followed by decreases in early (P50) as well as late (N140, P300) somatosensory-evoked potential (SEP) amplitudes. Second, stimulus timing along the cardiac cycle also affected perception. During systole, stimuli were detected and correctly localized less frequently, relating to a shift in perceptual sensitivity. This perceptual attenuation was accompanied by the suppression of only late SEP components (P300) and was stronger for individuals with a more stable heart rate. Both heart-related effects were independent of alpha oscillations’ influence on somatosensory processing. We explain cardiac cycle timing effects in a predictive coding account and suggest that HEP-related effects might reflect spontaneous shifts between interoception and exteroception or modulations of general attentional resources. Thus, our results provide a general conceptual framework to explain how internal signals can be integrated into our conscious perception of the world.}}

The inaccessibility of cognitive processes to direct manipulation can make such control difficult to realize. Here, we discuss approaches for overcoming this challenge. We advocate the incorporation of experimental techniques from sensory psychophysics into the study of cognitive processes such as decision making and executive control. These techniques include the use of simple parameterized stimuli to precisely manipulate available information and computational models to jointly quantify behavior and neural responses. We illustrate the potential for such techniques to drive theoretical development, and we examine important practical details of how to conduct controlled experiments when using them. Finally, we highlight principles guiding the use of computational models in studying the neural basis of cognition.}

For example, we recently showed that timing of stimulation along the cardiac cycle and spontaneous fluctuations of heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) amplitudes influence somatosensory perception and the associated neural processing (Al et al., 2020). While cardiac phase affected detection sensitivity and late components of the somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs), HEP amplitudes affected detection criterion and both early and late SEP components. In a new EEG study, we investigate whether these results are replicable in a modified paradigm, which includes two succeeding temporal intervals. In one of the intervals, subjects received a weak electrical finger stimulation and reported first whether they detected any stimulation and then allocated the stimulus to one of the two intervals. Our results confirm the previously reported cardiac cycle and prestimulus HEP effects on somatosensory perception and evoked potentials. In addition, we obtained two new findings. Source analyses in this and our original study show that the increased likelihood of conscious perception goes along with HEP fluctuations in parietal and posterior cingulate regions, known to play important roles in interoceptive processes. Furthermore, HEP amplitudes were shown to decrease when subjects engaged in the somatosensory task compared to a resting state condition. Our findings are consistent with the view that HEP amplitudes are a marker of interoceptive (versus exteroceptive) attention and provide a neural underpinning for this view.}

In parallel, interoceptive inference theories of affective perception and self-consciousness are on the rise in cognitive science. However, thus far no formal theory has emerged to integrate these twin domains; instead, most extant work is conceptual in nature. Here, we introduce a formal model of cardiac active inference, which explains how ascending cardiac signals entrain exteroceptive sensory perception and uncertainty. Through simulated psychophysics, we reproduce the defensive startle reflex and commonly reported effects linking the cardiac cycle to affective behaviour. We further show that simulated ‘interoceptive lesions’ blunt affective expectations, induce psychosomatic hallucinations, and exacerbate biases in perceptual uncertainty. Through synthetic heart-rate variability analyses, we illustrate how the balance of arousal-priors and visceral prediction errors produces idiosyncratic patterns of physiological reactivity. Our model thus offers a roadmap for computationally phenotyping disordered brain-body interaction.},

The link between perceptual awareness and cardiac signals has been investigated mainly in the visual and auditory domain. Here, we investigated whether the phase of the cardiac cycle and the prestimulus heart rate influence conscious somatosensory perception. We also tested how conscious detection of somatosensory stimuli affects the heart rate. Electrocardiograms (ECG) of 33 healthy volunteers were recorded while applying near-threshold electrical pulses at a fixed intensity to the left index finger. Conscious detection was not uniformly distributed across the cardiac cycle but significantly higher in diastole than in systole. We found no evidence that the heart rate before a stimulus influenced its detection, but hits (correctly detected somatosensory stimuli) led to a more pronounced cardiac deceleration than misses. Our findings demonstrate interactions between cardiac activity and conscious somatosensory perception, which highlights the importance of internal bodily states for sensory processing beyond the auditory and visual domain.},

  author   = "Lo, Steson and Andrews, Sally",
  abstract = "Linear mixed-effect models (LMMs) are being increasingly widely
              used in psychology to analyse multi-level research designs. This
              feature allows LMMs to address some of the problems identified by
              Speelman and McGann (2013) about the use of mean data, because
              they do not average across individual responses. However, recent
              guidelines for using LMM to analyse skewed reaction time (RT)
              data collected in many cognitive psychological studies recommend
              the application of non-linear transformations to satisfy
              assumptions of normality. Uncritical adoption of this
              recommendation has important theoretical implications which can
              yield misleading conclusions. For example, Balota et al. (2013)
              showed that analyses of raw RT produced additive effects of word
              frequency and stimulus quality on word identification, which
              conflicted with the interactive effects observed in analyses of
              transformed RT. Generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM)
              provide a solution to this problem by satisfying normality
              assumptions without the need for transformation. This allows
              differences between individuals to be properly assessed, using
              the metric most appropriate to the researcher's theoretical
              context. We outline the major theoretical decisions involved in
              specifying a GLMM, and illustrate them by reanalysing Balota et
